# Wake up Alien
```
This project was built on the back of a C# library provided in a book called
'Begin to code with C#' by Rob Miles.

This was one of my first introductions to the world of objects and how they
interact with each other.

Looking back I can see the the improvements that I have made. Specially having a
test driven development process in mind when working on projects.
