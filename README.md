# Wake up Alien

This project was built on the back of a C# library provided in 'Begin to code with C#'
by Rob Miles.

This was one of my first introductions to the world of objects and how they
interact with each other.

Looking back I can see the the improvements that I have made. Specifically having
test driven development process in mind.
